Yantar and Jupiter mobile science lab entrance is through an air lock chamber.
That entrance features 2 doors that can never be opened at the same time and provide decontamination before one can proceed inside or outside.

But it becomes hell when you're with a squad member , as when you forget to tell the friend to stay outside, the AI is always eager to stay too close to the door
Forcing it to re-open or just preventing it to close.
So you can't proceed through the chamber before ordering the AI to go away as it's not possible to open the 2nd door while the 1st one refuse to close.

For my own convenience, instead of having to order the AI to get out when i forgot to order him to stay out before, i just disabled the air lock chamber security.

This addon will then allow you (or the AI as it works for them too) to open both doors regardless if the first one is not closed.
